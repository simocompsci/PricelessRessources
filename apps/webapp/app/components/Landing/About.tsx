                        Our application is designed for people who save a lot of useful resources
                        they find online but often forget where they stored them, making it
                        difficult to use those resources later.

                        I created this app after realizing that my friends and I all faced the
                        same problem: we constantly save social media videos, links, books,
                        YouTube tutorials, and other resources we think will be useful, but we
                        rarely use them. Let’s be honest — we scroll too much and end up stacking
                        these resources instead of benefiting from them. That’s why we built this
                        solution: an app designed to help you actually use what you save. It’s
                        accessible on all your devices — whether you’re on your phone, your PC, or
                        even your smart refrigerator.
